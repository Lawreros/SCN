    "## Pytorch MRI image class\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to work out a class that I an consistently use for the super-resolution and just general image training of MRI and potentially other medical imaging data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's become clear that everyone seems to have a different, unique, way of loading and organizing their data into a format that can be fed into a Pytorch `Dataset` for training a model. This can include creating intermediate `.png` images in order to limit memory usage/training time on personal hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "Goals for this tool:\n",
    "1. Given an input folder, list all files that match a particular `prefix` and `suffix`\n",
    "2. Display sample images from the list for assurance\n",
    "3. Create randomly shuffled/altered images at different resolutions (gaussian blur, affine transformation, etc.)\n",
    "4. Save any image generated in a specified format\n",
    "5. Be given an input and output folder and generate list of matching data\n",
    "6. Have locations of matching low and high resolution images (potentially a list for every x2 magnification)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Output file labeling protocol:\n",
    "To keep things consistent I should probably create a labeling structure that is robust to future changes that I might want to make. This will most likely have to be stored in the string name, unless I want to make an intermediate file that is used as a key for the location of the files relative to the directory."
